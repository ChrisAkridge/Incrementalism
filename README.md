# Incrementalism
A "clicker"/incremental game based on the elements of the Code Louisville classroom. My project for our Front-End Web Development session.

To install this on your computer, just clone/download the repository and browse to `index.html` in your browser of choice. You can also see a version without installing it at https://www.akridgetech.com/incrementalism.

## How to play

Click or tap "0 units" to get started. Every click earns you 1 unit, and once you have 10, you can buy your first HDMI cable. HDMI cables, along with the other 11 items, all produce units for you automatically, but each successive item costs more than the last.

Unlock upgrades! You can get upgrades by clicking the units meter, or by earning a certain amount of units. Each upgrade costs units, but is worth it for the power-ups you can receive!
